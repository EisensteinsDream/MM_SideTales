// This header contains all the macro branches to indicate different operating systems and environments. This header is included at the top of cinclude.h, and should always be included before all other PLEX headers. Useful for cutting off sections of code which are only relevant to a particular environment. This is a foundational part of the entire PLEX library. As with all headers in the meta folder, there is no correlating source file.

// NOTE: I will eventually integrate mac, android, and ios. Likely also solaris and BSD at some point, compiling to those would be easy with few modifications. I also am planning on creating an in-browser version with enscriptem but that is a long term goal as I don't know how well it plays with certain dependecies.

// Number codes which indicate the bitrate of the environment. If undetectable XX_BIT is assigned. XX_BIT is assigned on default. I know the likelihood of this being compiled on a 16 bit environment is very low. I figure better safe than sorry, I guess.
