I was sulking one day at my then empty nest, jobless and waiting for some kind of assignment after my career aptitude points took a nosedive. I lost a custody case with my husband which was almost completely determined by said CA points. I was going to lose my home as well. That is until a man came to my door knocking. He served me papers. There had been a second lawsuit laid upon my feet from the deadbeat. This time, he wanted to take my name. I would have just become Pamaleana Codelli."

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE7 "Pameleana: Yes, I'm that very world famous playwrite and actress that you spoke to. I came up all the way from Toronto."

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE13 "Director: As you can see, I'm not working with the brightest of minds here. Now, Miss Barfton, I'm very intrigued by your proposal here. You say that you want to do an experimental theater in a sleazy motel room with the greatest method actor in the known world, right?"

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE14 "Pameleana: The greatest, you could slam a tin baseball bat square into his groin and he wouldn't break character.

Instead it ends up being a ruse to trap him in a place where she can embarrass him and force him to hash out their post-marital issues..."

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE22 "Pamaleana: Yes, and your guys will play the terrorists. I am co-starring as his ex."

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE26 "Pamaleana: Are you sure? You said yourself this is a great script. Maybe they'll all get behind that."

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE27 "Director: Probably not. Bigger picture problem is that they're all sniveling caffeine addicts and coffee is on short supply around here."

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE28 "Pamaleana: Ok so you want me to get them coffee?"

#define MMS_LANGUAGE_INTROB_LINE29 "Director: No, we have coffee in the break room. It's just... It's just this dreadful crew always wait until they're rehearsing then sneak in. They steal all our coffee. If we begin rehearsing this script then we're doomed. They'll be in a pile snoozing before the break even starts."

But if you bake a sweet, warm, delectable pie that is 5% truth and people eat the entire thing.

A nice breezy song for a brisk 54 C afternoon. And don't we feel lucky to be under the dome! In other news, Fitler Motor Company has opened a new line of wheelless cars in it's Hiesta line that auto experts believe will drive competitors to release models with price tags under 8-digits.

For those who don't know, Suzie Crampsqueeze is the legendary singer and lead guitarist to the infamous feminist anarchopunk band The Wild Clitori. Which, before her unexpected rise to stardom, was one of the most censored bands throughout all Canada. Which makes us here at KIBS think: Censoring a rock band? What a bunch of Nazis!"

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEM00 "Dr. Deeblock: You were very right in bringing her to us. This punk music is like an infection on our youth. It turns sweet, innocent, little angels into degenerates. Let me tell you a story from somewhere in a rural patch of Prince Edward Island. On a small farmhouse a father dies and the mother is left to raise her only son herself."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEM01 "Dr. Deeblock: This was a good kid, a smart kid, with a college scholarship. He also was a hard worker who did most of the farm work himself. He used to pray in the church every Sunday and every Saturday for good measure."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEM02 "Dr. Deeblock: One day, his mother let him listen to one punk song. That's all it took, one punk song. The next day he stabbed the mailman through the back of the neck! Seventeen times! That's all it took, one listen, one time."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEM03 "Dr. Deeblock: He was brought to us. Seven years later, he's in the military now. First gunner for a branch tasked to handle domestic uprisings. When you ask him how much punk he listens to, he chuckles. Because, the only thing his ears can tolerate anymore is patriotic Christian country. Has he been slitting throats in the core? No, the only violence he knew is a tragic and mysterious death of his bunkmate Travis..."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEM04 "Dr. Deeblock: Best part about this place is it's almost all volunteer staff and we're subsidized by the province of Ontario. So, all you need to do is pay us once and your dollar will last until however long your daughter needs to stay to be corrected."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEN02 "Pamaleana (Narration): It was too tough to stab a fork into but they didn't let us have knives. We had spoons - plastic spoons - with rubber tips. If were lucky and had a twenty minute lunch break, you might saw through three bites worth."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEN03 "Pamaleana: Of course, late at night, when it was just the security, and no medical staff, they'd let us have knives to bet on fights. I luckily slinked into the background enough to avoid this fate."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO02 "Dr. Deeblock: Well, yes, Miss Codelli. We haven't had many instances with you of note. But, that's the problem. You seem to behaving perfectly well... too perfectly well."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO03 "Dr. Deeblock: You see, there's two types of patients that lead me to suspect more time is needed."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO04 "Dr. Deeblock: The first type is the hopelessly disruptive types. The subjects who can't spend two seconds without gut punching a guard, or throwing their food across the room, or banging their own heads against the wall."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO05 "Dr. Deeblock: Then there's the second. The silent type. Those who, after great amounts of monitoring, seem to show absolutely no signs of rightfully being here."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO06 "Dr. Deeblock: The problem with this type is that we know they wouldn't be here for no reason. No one is here without reason, Miss Codelli."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO07 "Pamaleana: So... you want me to be disruptive, but not too disruptive?"

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO08 "Dr. Deeblock: See, that's exactly the cunning I expect from the latter type. You're smart, aware, you see what's going on. You can hold out much longer than the others. However, your true nature will be revealed eventually. It always is."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEO09 "Pamaleana: Ok, I'm sure it will be soon."

// SCENE P

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEP00 "Pamaleana (Narration): I could never actually figure out whether he was full of it, or not. I didn't want to miscalculate, though. There had to be a way to resolve Dr. Deeblock's little paradox. I tried to surmise some kind of rebellion but... I didn't have it in me. I don't know why. I suppose my mind left me stuck between what would be convincing and what would be too strong. A few more years passed..."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEP01 "Pamaleana (Narration): One day I was eating. Everything flatlined at that point. I began to realize everyone was faceless. I couldn't really feel anymore, either."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEP02 "Pamaleana (Narration): But I was talking. I was talking quite aptly, even. I was exchanging words with everybody around me but it didn't really feel as if I was hearing what I was saying. This is the most insane I ever felt in my life. I had a moving mouth, moving eyes, nodding head. But, my brain did not factor any of it in. I felt completely disembodied."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEP03 "Pamaleana (Narration): Something snapped me out of it, though. It was a someone, actually. Or, I guess, an earthquake of a someone. He had a face! How could that be? Even I felt faceless at that point in time. When I saw him he was being thumped pretty hard by the security. He appeared to be a screaming maniac with a pentagram burned into his uniform with smuggled cigarettes. I figured THAT is someone who could assist me in constructing a proper act of rebellion."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEP04 "Pamaleana: Who is that?"

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEQ13 "Pamaleana: Did he even notice?"

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEQ14 "HellDemon666: No, but his subordinates sure did. Seemed he wasn't as fun to be around for a few weeks. They beat the fuck out of me! Totally worth it, though. His wife eventually convinced him to stop wearing them. He's still in the dark as to why."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENEQ15 "Pamaleana: Yes, well, I need something he can notice. Just something that will convince me that whatever he thinks is wrong with me is fixable."

#define MMS3_LANGUAGE_SCENES02 "Dr. Deeblock: Well, let me tell you what, one of you will be set free tonight. No strings attatched, back into the world. Well, one string maybe. It involves that big red button you have under your hands there. Once either of you presses that button, the other is electrocuted. Once we have a breakhrough and one of you realizes the most effective strategy for your own mental health is to shock the other unconcious, you will be discharged!"
