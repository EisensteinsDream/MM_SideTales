Minigame 0 - Stop The Coffee Stealing Bastards:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	* You can push more than just the 4 tables. You can push the Coffee Drinking Bastards. You can push the table in which the coffee is on (ie. 'The Prize') as well.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Minigame 1 - Dome City Panic:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	* Doesn't seem to be a lot of cops, right? So, if there are no cops on this road then why are you following the rules? Perhaps bending the rules will get you to your destination more than being a square.

	* Going too fast now might not be going too fast in the end, right? You can always build up momentum now and brake near the end.

	* Notice there's 4 lanes of traffic and the traffic seems to roughly adhere to those 4. Notice on different sections of the road these lanes are populated by different styles of traffic. If you have to drink poison, maybe you should choose your poison carefully.

	* Speaking of picking your poison, it seems that sometimes crashing is somewhat inevitable or difficult to avoid entirely. Would you rather crash into a fruit crate or a massive garbage truck?

	* You hear honking or see a red 'oncoming' warning at the top of the screen? Somebody's coming from behind, get in a new lane!

Minigame 2 - Butch Cassidy, The Sunderance Kid, Kramer, and Kramer:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

	* Notice that stronger guns often have longer loading times. Possibly, it's better to use the stronger guns on weaker enemies where they will die in one shot and use the weaker guns with more ammo on the stronger enemies that require more shots.

	* Notice if you use a ammo-less weapon (knife or club) on an ammo crate you get the ammo of the next gun. Maybe in a pinch it's better to use these weapons rather than wasting ammo for the risk of getting more ammo.

	* Doesn't seem to replenish health every time you arrive at a new town. Perhaps the doc can help.

	* If it only costs 10$ to fill ammo, why bother getting that new gun if you can't?

	* Why are my points going down? Oh, I'm shooting animals. Animal cruelty is bad, fellas.

	* Taking down a big machine? Maybe this is the point you use your explosives. But before you do that, maybe you should measure your explosive use so as to make the most potent impact. You don't want to end up without explosives on the final stretch with an angry operator of a massive machine, do you?

	* Rapid fire guns should be used rapidly. Do not press once.

	* Sometimes maybe you should use your ammo to destroy obstructions enemies hide in between their generator times. That way you can hit them more easily when they regenerate. You don't want to use prime ammo for that, though, right?

	* Experiment with different guns on different enemies. Their load times, potency, and rate of fire may make them effective in different situations.
